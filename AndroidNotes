Android Notes

Background processing
	Work Manager:
		- great for running defereable work (work that doesn't impact the user's app expereince (uploading logs))
		- offers backward compatibility
	Download Manager:
	 	- long running http download
	ForegroundService:
	 	- need to do work immediately
	 	- Using a foreground service tells the system that the app is doing something important and it shouldnâ€™t be killed.
	 Run at precise time:
	 	- Alarm Manager

	Sending operations to multiple threads:
		- The speed and efficiency of a long-running, data-intensive operation often improves when you split it into smaller operations running on multiple threads
		- Use Runnable to define tasks
